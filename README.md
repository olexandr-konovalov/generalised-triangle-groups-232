# generalised-triangle-groups-232

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with the supplementary code for the
[arXiv:1612.00242 preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00242)
"Generalised triangle groups of type (2,3,2) with no cyclic essential representations"
by James Howie and Olexandr Konovalov.

Click on "launch binder" button to start a Jupyter notebook in which you will be able to
reproduce all steps of the calculation.
